guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text1=By dissolving the impurites found in Diamond Ore with the acidic gel of a slime, a slimy diamond slurry can be made. This slurry can be cooked in a furnace to make Diamonds!
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text2=By dissolving the impurites found in Gold Ore with the acidic gel of a slime, a slimy gold slurry can be made. This slurry can be cooked in a furnace to make Gold Ingots!
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text3=By dissolving the impurites found in Iron Ore with the acidic gel of a slime, a slimy iron slurry can be made. This slurry can be cooked in a furnace to make Iron Ingots!
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text4=For decades the hides of animals have been treated with acidic compounds to form a more resistant material known as leather. This process is pretty much the same just with the hide of a dead human.... try not to think too much about it.
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text5=Sandstone is just compressed sand held together by some form of binder, turns out this binder is not resistant to acid.
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text6=Similar to processing gravel in slimes, big bits of rock can dissolve to smaller bits inside a slime.
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text7=Gravel is a mixture of small and large chunks of silica, amongst other things. By feeding gravel to slimes and letting them work their magic we can partially dissolve those big bits of silica leaving smaller bits of silica.
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text8=Dirt is a blend of organic, siliceous and clay-like materials. Nothing destroys organic materials better than a nice strong acid wash.
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r1Text9=Sticks and feathers are easily dissolved in a slimes acidity, because of this arrows can easily be recycled.

guiSlimepedia.recipe.r2Text1=One application of the Clear Slime Crystal is its ability to allow slimes to coat tools and armours with gel. Armours and tools coated in this gel exhibit different properties depending on the slime used to coat them!
guiSlimepedia.recipe.r2Text2=By dissolving diamond and glass in a 1 : 5 ratio a new type of semi-crystaline material can be made. This crystal is neither a solid nor liquid and has practically limitless applications.

guiSlimepedia.book.left1=Introduction
guiSlimepedia.book.left2=Welcome to the SlimeBreeder Advance manual, your one stop guide to all things related to slime breeding!\n\nSlimes have been present in the Overworld ever since the alpha era, yet only recently has colour variations of the slime species been found in the world.\n\nWhilst the appearance of this new type of slime has had little to no impact on the Overworld's ecology, the sudden appearance of a new, more versatile, breed of slime is concern enough for the indepth study of their nature.\n\nInitially, the study of 'Coloured Slimes' was a dangerous endevour with some slime variations capable of not only moving faster but also dealing more damage than the average slime. The discovery of the ability to not only be able to breed but also to tame these Coloured Slimes was the first major breakthrough in the study of these dangerous creatures. 
guiSlimepedia.book.left3=Finding Slimes
guiSlimepedia.book.left4=\n\n''Slimes are made of a gelatinous water based acid and because of this they love the rain!''\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.left5=Coloured Slimes are adaptive creatures which come in a variety of colours and shades and while there has been no link determined between the biome found in and the colour of slime, it has been noted that there is more

guiSlimepedia.book.left12=Slime Care
guiSlimepedia.book.left13=Coloured Slimes are aggressive creatures which wont hesitate to try and make you their next meal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.left14=\n\n''Right-Click a Coloured Slime with some raw chicken to feed it!''\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.left15=Feed a slime some raw chicken will not only satiate it's appetite but also improve its affection to you. A happy slime is a less homicidal slime!
guiSlimepedia.book.left16=Slime Care
guiSlimepedia.book.left17=Petting or feeding a slime increases a slimes
guiSlimepedia.book.left18=Domestication
guiSlimepedia.book.left19=. Once a slime's domestication reaches a high enough level the slime will no longer

guiSlimepedia.book.left22=''Coloured Slimes will occasionally emit hearts when domesticated!''
guiSlimepedia.book.left23=Slime Breeding 101
guiSlimepedia.book.left24=The first major breakthrough in the research of Colour Slimes was the discovery of their ability to breed, a characteristic not witnessed with regular slimes.\n\nThis characteristic arises from the Coloured Slimes dormant genes which can be activated by what is known as a ''Breeding catalyst''.\n\nBreeding catalysts are a unique blend of monster components capable of activating hidden behaviors in Coloured Slimes such as the active desire to reproduce as well as the need to consume chicken.\n\nAs a side effect, this new found dependancy of chicken leaves the Coloured Slime open to the possibility of forming a symbiotic relationship with the breeder.   
guiSlimepedia.book.left25=Slime Breeding 101
guiSlimepedia.book.left26=These capsules can also be used as a means to capture slime samples. Inspecting slime samples can reveal important information about a slime's genetics
guiSlimepedia.book.left27=\n\n''Empty Slime Capsules can be used as ammo in the Slimalyzer to collect samples!''
guiSlimepedia.book.left28=Slime Genetics
guiSlimepedia.book.left29=Upon discovery of the Coloured Slime, it was immediately obvious that the properties of a Coloured Slime is directly related to its' colour.\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.left30=''Red Slimes can move quickly, breed fast and are easily killed!''\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.left31=''Purple Slimes on the other hand are tough, slow moving and slow to breed!''
guiSlimepedia.book.left32=\n\nHowever slime genetics are not all that simple; it appears that as side-effect of the breeding process, a slime's offspring's attributes are an average of its' parents!
guiSlimepedia.book.left33=Slime Crafting
guiSlimepedia.book.left34=One of the most recent, and most surprising discoveries about Coloured Slimes, is their ability to ''craft'' items inside themselves.\n\nWhen an item is inserted into a slime it is partially dissolved by the slime's acidic gel. This process of dissolving items allows slime to hold a ridiculous number of items inside themselves!\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.left35=''A Coloured Slime can hold a near infinite number of 5 different items inside itself!''\n\n''Killing a slime containing the correct mixture of dissolved items can create surprising new items.''
guiSlimepedia.book.left36=\n\nThis amazing discovery is not however without flaws, in despite of extensive research it has been found that factors such the acidity and free-flowing nature of the slime can limit what items are able to be dissolved into a slime, thus limiting certain ''recipes'' to select slimes.

guiSlimepedia.book.right1=Introduction
guiSlimepedia.book.right2=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaring for Coloured Slimes is as easy as giving candy to a baby, a baby that wants to kill you.                -Anomalous
guiSlimepedia.book.right3=Finding Slimes
guiSlimepedia.book.right4=In fact, Coloured Slimes so adaptive, the only requirement for their survival is the presence of excessive atmospheric moisture, e.g rain, and because of this they can be found in a range of biomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                 ........And Many More
guiSlimepedia.book.right5=Slime Care
guiSlimepedia.book.right6=But how do you know when your slime is hungry?\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right7=Coloured Slimes, like most monsters can't talk, but this however does not stop them communicating with their breeder.\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right8=''Slimes use particle effects to show you what they need!''\n\n

guiSlimepedia.book.right20=Once domesticated a slime can be commanded to follow, to wait or allowed to roam free.\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right21=''Shift-Right click a domesticated slime to cycle between the different command states!''
guiSlimepedia.book.right22=\n\nBreeders must be careful though, as domesticated slimes can lose their domestication if left hungry for too long! When a slime gets below a certain amount of hunger they can slowly lose domestication, the point at which a slime gets hungry is determined by a slimes metabolism.\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right23=''A general rule of thumb: the faster a slime breeds the faster it gets hungry!''\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right24=Breeding is also a very intensive process which may make a slime hungry!
guiSlimepedia.book.right25=Slime Breeding 101
guiSlimepedia.book.right26=The first time a slime has been activated by a breeding catalyst, it will immediately be able to breed, and begin searching for a breeding partner as long as the slime is not hungry!\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right27=''Once activated the slime and all of its offspring will be able to breed.''
guiSlimepedia.book.right28=Slime Breeding 101
guiSlimepedia.book.right29=Shift-Right click with the Slimalyzer to open its' gui. The Slimalyzer gui is used to compare samples with other items to check their colour similarity.\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right30=''If a sample and an item have more that 90 percent similarity then the slime should drop the item on death, in theory...''\n\n
guiSlimepedia.book.right31=Slime Genetics
guiSlimepedia.book.right32=The genetics of a slime can be described by 5 different categories:\n\n\nSlimes are naturally sticky, the more sticky a slime, the harder they are to escape from after getting hit.\n\n\nTouching a slime hurts, this is due to the acidic property of slime. While less acidic slimes are safer, they are also less effective at dissolving items.\n\n\nRubbery slimes are naturally resistant to damage and are harder to kill.\n\n\nActive slimes are fast breeding slimes, they eat often too.\n\n\nThe more free-flowing a slime's slime, the faster it moves!
